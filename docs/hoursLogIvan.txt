TODO: 
    Implement leaderboards properly
    Show the name of the two players during the game
    Remove some alerts maybe (kinda annoying)
    Keep client connected during page transitions
    Allow for accept/decline buttons next to the challenge button (maybe multiple people challenge)
    Make firefox hold off on displaying until all resources are loaded first
    Maybe add icon using /favicon.ico
    Make login/signup not show you a 200 or 400 status (automatically redirect to lobby.html)
    Document a lot of code
    Refactor some code since there is a lot of duplication
    Modularize the code so less mistakes can happen and so mistakes can be spotted
    Add logout button
    Add obvious login/signup buttons when not logged in
    Make errors more obvious (instead of telling the console that you are not authorized, tell the user in a popup or notification, or gray out the option)
    Make code more resilient (prevent user from easily crashing it). If something catastrophic happens it's better to just catch the error and undo or reset whatever was affected
    Style with CSS
    Investigate faulty behavior with events (the client sometimes doesn't synchronize with server correctly)
    Maybe implement passwords? (that can be much much later if we still want to)
    Tell the user who is signed in at all times (at the top right or something) (we don't want to look at cookies to determine which account we are in)
    If the game is still going then in the lobby there should also be a button to rejoin the game (or anywhere)
    Make it so that the server ends the game if a player leaves the game intentionally or starts another game (losing connection is ok)
    Make the configs for the server be on a file. So that the ip and port can be chosen in a config, as well as any other security details.
    Challenging self is kinda buggy (requires a reload for some reason).
    Have the challenge popup happen anywhere (maybe they are in a game, looking at the leaderboard, or in a different page but still online)
    Following from the previous TODO, make the notification appear in situations where the user is loading into a different page
